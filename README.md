![screenshot](./app/assets/images/image-cashapp.png)

he can have a list of transactions associated with a category, so that he can see how much money you spent and on what.

This Ruby on Rails application allows the user to:

* register and log in, so that the data is private to them.
* introduce new transactions associated with a category.
* see the money spent on each category.
